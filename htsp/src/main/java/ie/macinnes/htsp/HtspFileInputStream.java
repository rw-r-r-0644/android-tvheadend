    /**
     * Reads up to <code>len</code> bytes of data from the input stream into
     * an array of bytes.  An attempt is made to read as many as
     * <code>len</code> bytes, but a smaller number may be read.
     * The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer.
     * <p>
     * <p> This method blocks until input data is available, end of file is
     * detected, or an exception is thrown.
     * <p>
     * <p> If <code>len</code> is zero, then no bytes are read and
     * <code>0</code> is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at
     * least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at end of
     * file, the value <code>-1</code> is returned; otherwise, at least one
     * byte is read and stored into <code>b</code>.
     * <p>
     * <p> The first byte read is stored into element <code>b[off]</code>, the
     * next one into <code>b[off+1]</code>, and so on. The number of bytes read
     * is, at most, equal to <code>len</code>. Let <i>k</i> be the number of
     * bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in elements
     * <code>b[off]</code> through <code>b[off+</code><i>k</i><code>-1]</code>,
     * leaving elements <code>b[off+</code><i>k</i><code>]</code> through
     * <code>b[off+len-1]</code> unaffected.
     * <p>
     * <p> In every case, elements <code>b[0]</code> through
     * <code>b[off]</code> and elements <code>b[off+len]</code> through
     * <code>b[b.length-1]</code> are unaffected.
     * <p>
     * <p> The <code>read(b,</code> <code>off,</code> <code>len)</code> method
     * for class <code>InputStream</code> simply calls the method
     * <code>read()</code> repeatedly. If the first such call results in an
     * <code>IOException</code>, that exception is returned from the call to
     * the <code>read(b,</code> <code>off,</code> <code>len)</code> method.  If
     * any subsequent call to <code>read()</code> results in a
     * <code>IOException</code>, the exception is caught and treated as if it
     * were end of file; the bytes read up to that point are stored into
     * <code>b</code> and the number of bytes read before the exception
     * occurred is returned. The default implementation of this method blocks
     * until the requested amount of input data <code>len</code> has been read,
     * end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown. Subclasses are encouraged
     * to provide a more efficient implementation of this method.
     *
     * @param b   the buffer into which the data is read.
     * @param off the start offset in array <code>b</code>
     *            at which the data is written.
     * @param len the maximum number of bytes to read.
     * @return the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or
     * <code>-1</code> if there is no more data because the end of
     * the stream has been reached.
     * @throws IOException               If the first byte cannot be read for any reason
     *                                   other than end of file, or if the input stream has been closed, or if
     *                                   some other I/O error occurs.
     * @throws NullPointerException      If <code>b</code> is <code>null</code>.
     * @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException If <code>off</code> is negative,
     *                                   <code>len</code> is negative, or <code>len</code> is greater than
